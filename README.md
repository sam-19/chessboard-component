# chessboard-component

A web component to insert a custom <chess-board> element on your web pages.

## Documentation

This is a refactoring of Justin Fagnani's [chessboard-element](https://github.com/justinfagnani/chessboard-element), edited to meet my specific needs.

For a general purpose chessboard web component, please see the original project's documentation:
